Two View Compass App
This project shows two view compass. This app shows us what direction and degree you are standing or moving around. I have cresated this app myself. This app lets person know which way you are standing. Also, this app lets driver know which way you are driving. Generally, the compass indicates 8 poles of direction with degrees. Howerver, this app is different from other compass. This app indicates 16 poles of direction with degrees. It shows us two images to clearly tell what exactly poles and degree we are standing or moving around. When you are rotating your phone, this app tells you clearly with two images and make you understand which poles and degrees you are.
